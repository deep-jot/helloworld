this is a git file

Edited in remote repository text editor as another developer
.Tried to demonstrate git pull origin master

Trying to see origin in place of whole URL. Tested git remote-v works well.
Output of git remote -v
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/deep-jot/helloworld (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/deep-jot/helloworld (push)
